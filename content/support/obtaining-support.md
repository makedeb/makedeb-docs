{{< notice "warning" >}}
If you need to report a security vulnerability in one of makedeb's products, please see [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](/support/reporting-security-vulnerabilities).
{{< /notice >}}

makedeb uses [Matrix](https://matrix.org) as its primary method for communication and support. We also have a bridge for some rooms to Discord if you prefer to use that platform.

{{< notice "note" >}}
All platforms have access to the makedeb Bot, which performs various actions across the support rooms.

To interact with the bot, send a message prefixed with `!makedeb` in any of makedeb's rooms. A full list of commands can be found with `!makedeb help`.

## Matrix Rooms

All rooms are joinable via the Matrix space at [#makedeb:{{< hw_url >}}](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb:{{< hw_url >}}).

If your client doesn't support Matrix spaces, you can join each room individually:

- makedeb General: [#makedeb-project:{{< hw_url >}}](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb-project:{{< hw_url >}})
- makedeb Contributing: [#makedeb-contributing:{{< hw_url >}}](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb-contributing:{{< hw_url >}})
- makedeb CI Logs: [#makedeb-ci-logs:{{< hw_url >}}](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb-ci-logs:{{< hw_url >}})
- MPR General: [#makedeb-mpr:{{< hw_url >}}](https://matrix.to/#/#makedeb-mpr:{{< hw_url >}})

## Discord

The Discord server can be joined at https://discord.gg/R3MhyghtMD.
